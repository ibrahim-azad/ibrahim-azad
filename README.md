## About Me

I'm a 20-year-old CS student at FAST Islamabad with a focus on AI and GPU computing. I enjoy solving challenging programming problems and building efficient systems - whether it's optimizing GPU kernels, building games in C++, or working with AI frameworks. I like understanding how things work at every level, from high-level logic down to hardware.
